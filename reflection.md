I said this in the previous reflection, but to once again give background I'm very interested in the open source world.
To this end, I often support making as much information as possible readily accessible.
The more documentation you provide, the better it is for everyone.
A critical element to this is the nuance of making a simple, ready-to-use, complete package so a user can just plug and play, but also providing enough information for future developers to go and expand upon the source code.
With this in mind, the two James Baker readings really stood out.

In *The hard digital history that underpins my book*, Baker states "I didnâ€™t hide this digital work, rather much like a great deal of the other research that goes into a monograph, not everything made it to the surface of the final product".
While it is critical to remove excess information to be as clear and concise as possible, excluding access carries its own ramifications.
Much like open source software, the more information a creator provides about how they did their work, the more future work is made possible.
Were it not for the blog post, someone trying to further Baker's research would need to go through similar steps Baker himself went through to understand why Baker did things like excluding the stationers from his map.
While this specifically is a relatively minor step, the incremental changes to the presentation of data will grow and can become very difficult to retrace someone's steps.
Additionally, excluding one's work can result in biases being hidden.
It's very easy to present data into saying many different, conflicting ideas.
Every element in displaying data is a delibrate choice, whether it be for strictly appearance/digestability or changing focus.
When attempting to further someone's research, having to stop and question "why was this done the way it was" will become not only a question of figuring out their research, but a consideration of the author's bias.
To promote the continuation of research, I believe showing as much work as is reasonably possible is important for future research.
It is important to note the caveat of the work should be seperated from the final publicized work, much like how a precompiled binary would not be distributed with it's source code.
